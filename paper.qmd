abstract: "Election rules serve a crucial role in affecting political outcomes by controlling the way votes are converted into legislative seats, which in turn determines a nation's representation, party system, and organizational framework. In the end, they control the course of policy and the stability of democratic institutions by directly impacting the dynamics of political rivalry, voter involvement, and the broadening of the political process. We replicate some steps of comparing two-round election and one-round election. The results were consistent with the initial study."
