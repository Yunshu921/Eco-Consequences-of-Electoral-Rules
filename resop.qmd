## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
# Install the packages that we need
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("AustralianPoliticians")
# Load the packages that we need to use this time
library(tidyverse)
library(AustralianPoliticians)

# Make a table of the counts of genders of the prime ministers
get_auspol("all") |> # Imports data from GitHub
  as_tibble() |>
  filter(wasPrimeMinister == 1) |>
  count(gender)
```
